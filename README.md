Project - ML Model Development Based on Brazil’s COVID-19 Dataset
Description
Brazil is among the nations most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 16 million confirmed cases and 454,429 confirmed fatalities by May 26, 2021 (according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center).

During the first wave of COVID-19, Brazil faced unprecedented challenges due to the strain on hospital capacity, including high demand for ICU beds, healthcare professionals, personal protection equipment, and medical resources.

To address this issue, a team of data scientists at Sirio Libanês Hospital in Brazil sought to reduce ICU bed strain by developing a machine learning model. The model's goal is to predict whether patients with confirmed COVID-19 cases would require ICU admission.

The dataset used for this project, released on the Kaggle platform (Dataset Link), includes clinical data from COVID-19 patients and the target group (those admitted to the ICU).

This project focuses on building a classification model to predict ICU admission.

Scope and Deliverables
