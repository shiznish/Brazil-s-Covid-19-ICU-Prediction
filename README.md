# Project - ML Model Development Based on Brazilâ€™s COVID-19 Dataset  

## Description  
Brazil is among the nations most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 16 million confirmed cases and 454,429 confirmed fatalities by May 26, 2021 (according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center).  

## Scope and Deliverables  

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize data distributions, relationships, and trends.  
   - Identify missing values and potential outliers.  

2. **Data Pre-Processing**  
   - Handle missing values and outliers.  
   - Normalize and encode features as necessary.  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.  

3. **Model Creation and Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Train and evaluate different classification models.  
   - Optimize the model using hyperparameter tuning.  

4. **Conclusion**  
   - Summarize key findings and model performance.  
   - Provide recommendations based on predictions.
